                    Everything starts. Whitout a computer, my daily fun was pass
                    all day long playing Counter-Strick on a lan-house with my
                    cousin Vinicius and my Friend Guilherme.

                  <p>
                    One day, we've met Tibia. Hunting rats and rotworms was our
                    diary addicting, but without a penny to pay Premium Account,
                    we've seen other way to have more fun.

                  <p>
                    Then we've started play OT's, wich was non official server
                    that allow us to play the hole game for free.
